# My_Perfect_Arch-linux

### This is a guide/personal reference/explanation of an ideal arch linux base install + all the good ricing on top of it. I am mainly creating this as a personal reference guide, but hope it's also helpful to someone else learning this stuff.

### Summary
In this guide, I will do a minimal arch installation from scratch. I will be installing the os on a fresh drive. I will partition it using btrfs, as I want to setup up snapper and rollback features. I will also encrypt my root partition using LUKS2. On top of all this, I will generate my own secure boot keys and sign all the bootable binaries. Finally I will install Hyprland and other related utilities to make it look good and perform well. I will try to make it as modular and platform agnostic as possible to account for other people using this guide. Let's go:

## Pre-Install
1. Download the arch.iso file and burn it to a usb drive (diy).
2. Disable secure boot from your motherboard's firmware if it's enabled, as otherwise your usb wont boot.
3. If you are dual-booting and/or have multiple disks in your system, make sure to identify which drive you want to install the linux system on. I would highly highly recommend a separate drive for arch or any other linux distro for that matter in case of dual booting with windows. 
4. Identify your locale and timezone data.
